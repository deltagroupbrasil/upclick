# Repository Sync Status

As of this check, no Git remote named `origin` is configured in this local clone, so commits cannot be pushed to `https://github.com/deltagroupbrasil/upclick` from here. Configure the remote with:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/deltagroupbrasil/upclick.git
```

Then push the current `work` branch with:

```
git push -u origin work
```

Ensure your token or SSH key has the necessary permissions before attempting the push.
